# Web Development Resources

This is a curated collection of resources related to web development 
languages and tools that I have found useful or interesting.  This isn't
to say that this is only web-related stuff, but sorta kinda mostly.  Also,
and just because I don't want any clutter in here, I am not putting links
to a whole host of tools that do not stand out as elegant or performant.
